## Overview
[^Top of page](#)

ABAP Cloud is the development model for building clean core compliant apps, services, and extensions on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, and SAP BTP ABAP Environment. ABAP Cloud covers different development scenarios such as transactional, analytical, inegration, and enterprise search scenarios. The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) is the heart of ABAP Cloud for building transactional SAP Fiori apps, OData-based Web API, local APIs, and business events.

> This hands-on session introduces attendees to practice fusion development of ABAP Cloud in SAP Build solutions by creating an ABAP Cloud project from the lobby for SAP Build, model the data model using the graphical modeller in SAP Build Code and to implement the ABAP RESTful application programming model business object using ADT, including an SAP Fiori app on top.
